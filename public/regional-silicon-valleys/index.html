	<br/><br/>
	<p>
		5.1 When you create your Registered User profile ("Profile") (Registered Users only) your user name, chosen contact email address and any other information you have chosen to make public will be available to other Users and you will be making that personal information publicly available to all other Users of the Site and you do so at your own risk.
